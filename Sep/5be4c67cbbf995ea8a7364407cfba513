A special bull will be slaughtered during the burial of veteran Narok politician and former Cabinet minister William ole Ntimama in accordance with Maasai culture. Speaking to journalists at the late politicians home in Motonyi near Narok town, burial committee chairman Hassan ole Kamwaro revealed that the sacred bull should be of uniform hue and given by the family. &quot;Culturally,when a person of Ntimamas stature dies, a big bull is identified among the herd. As at now, we are in the process of getting one and in case there is none found in his herd, his oldest son will have to get one,&quot; said Mr Kamwaro. The bull, he said, would be slaughtered specially for Ntimamas age mates and other elders who would also bless the body before burial. Kamwaro, who was accompanied by Ntimamas son Timothy, said the burial arrangements for the long-serving Narok North legislator were going on smoothy.
