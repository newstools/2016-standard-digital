Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i has directed school heads to desist from compelling parents to buy school items from specific outlets. In his speech read by director for Adult and Continuing Education Kinara Nyabwari, the CS said parents should be allowed to shop for school items in a free market. He said school administrators were fond of forcing students to buy uniform, games attire and stationery from specific outlets that charge higher rates. "Principals are advised that parents must be allowed to buy uniform and other items in a free market without prejudice or preference for certain suppliers," read part of the speech. Parents had earlier raised concern that most schools compelled them to buy school items from specific suppliers who charged exorbitant prices. They noted that some school heads and other administrators of secondary institutions worked in cahoots with unscrupulous traders to extort them especially during intake of Form One students. UNORTHODOX MEANS The CS reiterated the Government's commitment to make education affordable for all, noting that it will not condone those who use unorthodox means to extort parents. He disclosed that the number of Form One places nationally had grown from 759,603 to 790,680 over the last one year with a projected transition rate of 83.58 from primary to secondary schools. The CS added that more resources had been invested in the expansion of training opportunities in polytechnics and adult continuing students to meet the gaps of the transition rate to secondary schools. Mr Nyabwari read the speech yesterday during the launch of second level Form One selection exercise for Trans Nzoia, West Pokot and Turkana counties at Kitale School.
